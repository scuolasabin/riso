        <h1>The rice "blanket"</h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>Rice paddies are covered with water from April to June to help rice grow. <br />
		Water is like a "blanket" and it protects the young plants from sudden changes in temperature: during the day it absorbs the heat slowly and, slowly,  gives it back. <br />
		Young rice plants covered with water grow better thanks to a more constant temperature of the environment.
		<br />
		Nowadays, water is eutrophic, that is rich in nourishment, because of a too high concentration of nutritional elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus coming from natural or chemical sources (such as industrial waste, certain detergents and so on...).<br />
		<br />
		Eutrophic water is full of small water fauna that uses water oxygen up, leaving a very small quantity to rice plants. That is why water covering rice paddies isn't deep at all, only few centimeters: in this way, rice plats can take oxygen through their leaves outside water as soon as they grow.</p>
