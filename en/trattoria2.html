        <h1>The windows of Zafferano</h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>In 1574, during the construction of Milan's cathedral,  the glazier "Valerio di Fiandra" (from the Flandres) and his helpers were in charge of making its windows.<br />
		His main helper was "Zafferano" (Saffron),  so called because  he used the yellow powder to make colours brighter. <br /> 
		For this reason Valerio made fun of him, saying that he would put it anywhere, even into the "risotto".<br />
		To get his revenge after years of jokes,  at the marriage of his master's  daughter, Saffron put the spice into the "risotto".<br />
		To tell the truth, he didn't succeed in playing a trick because everybody liked  that new "risotto".<br />
		This is how "Risotto alla Milanese" was born.</p>
