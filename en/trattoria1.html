        <p>Every year, rice paddies worldwide use up about 1,350 billion cubic meters of water. <br />
		2,300 liters of water are needed to produce one kilo of integral rice. <br />
		One grain of rice normally  weights 0.019 grams, so one packet of rice (1kg) contains about 52,630 grains. <br />	
		In several countries,  there are a lot of legends about rice:  one of these is about the Prophet Mohammed. It tells that a drop of his sweat, falling from the sky, originated a rice plant.<br /> 
		In India the rice is so sacred that before eating it, it is necessary to get purified through ablutions. <br />
		Once in India, during funerals, rice was given to crows to protect the souls of the dead. <br />
		At the birth of a daughter of a Brahmin, the father asks the other women to leave the room and he puts red rice on his daughter's head to drive away the evil eye.</p>
